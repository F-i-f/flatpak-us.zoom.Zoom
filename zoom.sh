# Chromium's singleton mechanism is active in Zoom but doesn't actually work -
# it uses a Qt mechanism instead. Chromium in Zoom looks for its socket in folders
# named with the PID, so normally it won't find it. But PID namespaces mean two
# Zoom instances can think they have the same PID, and then the second tries
# to use this mechanism, but it does nothing (and it won't try to use the Qt
# singleton mechanism). Deleting these sockets bypasses this.
